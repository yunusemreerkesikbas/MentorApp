# Coaching

> The daily ritual loop: Panel hub, plan tasks, Pomodoro session, mock-exam analysis, streak, mood,
> ghost (geçmiş-ben), vision board. Module: `modules/coaching`. Workstream: W2.
> Roadmap: MVP; Phase 2 adds ambient sound, coach-built study plans, calendar integrations.

## Overview

Coaching is the companionship core — the daily loop that keeps a student going. It produces the
`/panel` composite payload (greeting · calm countdown · streak · today's plan · session presets ·
mood), plan-task CRUD, Pomodoro-style study sessions, deneme (mock-exam) entry + personal trend
analysis (no ranking), a read-time-derived streak with monthly freeze tokens, mood check-ins, a
"geçmiş-ben" (past-self) comparison, and a single-goal vision board. The deeper AI layer (mood
reflection, ghost narration, vision note) is owned by the [AI module](./ai.md) — coaching owns the
domain logic + persistence and exposes setters the AI module calls.

## Architecture (key decisions)

- **Bounded context** `apps/api/src/modules/coaching/**` — domain/application/infrastructure/
  presentation layering (mirrors `identity`). Wired into `app.module.ts` (one alphabetical line).
- **Tables (append-only `/* W2 · coaching */` schema block):** `plan_tasks`, `study_sessions`,
  `daily_activity` (UNIQUE user+date), `streak_state` (UNIQUE user), `mood_checkins` (UNIQUE
  user+date), `mock_exams` + `mock_exam_subjects`, `mock_exam_photo_categorizations`, `vision_boards`
  (UNIQUE user). Migration `drizzle/0002_w2_coaching.sql` + later deltas. RLS ENABLE+FORCE per-user
  policies on every table (matching the 0001 pattern).
- **Streak = read-time derived** (no cron): pure `domain/streak.ts` walks `daily_activity` backward;
  a single missed day is bridged by one of 2 monthly freeze tokens; two consecutive misses
  soft-reset. Idempotent (always derives from active dates + monthly allowance → no token double-spend).
  `current_streak` is recomputed on read; `freeze_tokens` = monthly allowance − this month's bridges.
- **Day math is UTC** (`domain/date.util.ts`); `daily_activity.activity_date` for a session = UTC date
  of `started_at`. Per-user timezone can be threaded later without changing the pure helpers.
- **ContentPort seam:** `domain/content.port.ts` (interface + `CONTENT_PORT` token) bound to the W1
  `ContentServiceAdapter`. Countdown reads `users.examType` via **identity `UsersService.getMe`**,
  never a coaching query on `users`, never `users.examDate` (deprecated/ignored for countdown).
- **Net rule** (`domain/net.ts`): KPSS penalty rule from `exams.netRule` — net is **never** computed
  on the frontend; display `totalNet` / `net` from the API only.
- **Repositories take the RLS-scoped `tx`** (opened by the service via `withUserContext`) so
  multi-table writes (task/session ↔ `daily_activity`) are atomic. Don't open a second tx inside a repo.
- **AI seam (workstreams §2):** AI never writes coaching tables — it calls `MoodService.
  setTodayAiReflection`, `MockExamService.setLatestGhostNarration`, `VisionService.setAiNote`.

## Geliştirmeler (timeline)

- **Panel (Anasayfa) UI** — `/panel` Server Component: greeting, calm countdown (blue, no alarm-red),
  streak badge (anti-shaming), today's plan list, start-session CTA, mood check-in. Six `@mentor/ui`
  primitives (`SectionHeading`, `DataCard`, `CountdownCard`, `StreakBadge`, `PlanListItem`,
  `MoodPicker`). `PanelShell` loads `GET /v1/coaching/today` client-side (token in memory). *(0013.)*
- **Panel mobile-first redesign** — `/panel` now uses an app-like header with Puhu + earned-rights
  economy capsule, a wellness-style "Bugünkü ritim" summary, a language-app-inspired weekly streak
  card, and a compact ritual task/CTA card. Data still comes from `GET /v1/coaching/today` and
  `/v1/economy/balance`; no leaderboard or alarm framing was introduced. Header greeting is time-aware
  and the notification trigger stays in the app shell to avoid duplicate bells. Mood check-in now opens
  through the shared `@mentor/ui` dialog as a dismissible Puhu mood modal when today's check-in is
  missing; "Daha sonra sor" only postpones for the current visit. Related file:
  `apps/web/src/app/[locale]/(app)/panel/_components/panel-shell.tsx`.
- **Coaching daily-loop (backend)** — new `modules/coaching` bounded context; 5 tables + RLS;
  composite `/today` endpoint; plan/session/mood endpoints; streak = read-time derived; ContentPort
  seam bound to W1 adapter. Shared contracts in `@mentor/types`/`@mentor/validation`. *(0014.)*
- **Plan + Seans UI** — `/plan` full CRUD (list by date, create, toggle, delete); `/seans` Pomodoro
  (preset select, client timer, `POST/PATCH study-sessions` finalize). Manual URL for `?date=` until
  OpenAPI exposes the query param; `useSearchParams` wrapped in `<Suspense>`. *(0021.)*
- **Plan page refactor (3 views)** — `/plan` now has a segmented switcher: **Liste** (checklist +
  progress %), **Timeline** (Zendenta-style rail + Yapılacak/Tamamlanan cards), **Hafta** (7-day
  strip + selected-day tasks). View mode persists in `localStorage` (`mentor.plan.viewMode`). Add
  task moved to bottom sheet + sticky CTA (mobile above tab bar); date picker sheet via calendar
  icon. Week data = 7 parallel `GET /v1/plan-tasks?date=` calls (`listPlanTasksForWeek`) until a
  `from`/`to` API lands. Date sheet uses `react-day-picker` v10 (TR/EN `date-fns` locale, Monday
  week start, DESIGN token overrides in `globals.css`). Selected day = full black circle +
  white label; days with tasks show a progress dot under the number. Calendar dots =
  **one** `GET /v1/plan-tasks/calendar?from=&to=` per visible month (not N day fetches). Files:
  `apps/web/src/app/[locale]/(app)/plan/_components/*`.
- **Mock exam + analysis** — `subjects`/`exam_subjects` seed + KPSS taxonomy endpoint; `mock_exams`/
  `mock_exam_subjects`; `domain/net.ts` (KPSS penalty rule); `/analiz` UI (per-subject D/Y/Boş,
  ProgressBar trend — no chart lib). *(0022-w2.)*
- **Panel UI polish** — shared `stagger-motion.ts`; `PanelShell` header fade + grid stagger;
  `CountdownPlaceholder` (CTA → `/profil` when `examType` missing; editorial-gap message when type
  set but no calendar seed); `StartSessionCta` extracted (Link-as-button, valid HTML). *(0033.)*
- **Plan + Seans UI polish** — `PlanShell`/`SeansShell` motion + `AnimatePresence` phase transitions
  (idle → focus/break → done); `SectionHeading` preset picker; eslint-safe fetch (`active` flag). *(0037.)*
- **Analiz UI polish** — `AnalizShell` `LoadState` union (separates `needs_exam_type` from API
  errors); always-visible trend card with chip empty state; tabular nums; calm subtitle (no ranking). *(0038.)*
- **Seans circular timer + custom duration** — `CircularTimerRing` in `@mentor/ui` (SVG progress
  ring, drag/touch dial 5–120 dk, keyboard +/-); zorunlu mola fazı kaldırıldı (mola = kullanıcı
  duraklatması); `preset: "custom"` + `study_sessions.planned_focus_minutes` column (migration 0016). *(0044.)*
- **Ghost (geçmiş-ben) + premium AI narration** — `domain/ghost.ts` pure comparison of latest vs OWN
  past (signed net deltas, personal record flag, i18n headline keys — no cross-user ranking §0);
  `GET /analysis` gains `ghost` (null until ≥2 attempts); `mock_exams` += AI cache columns. Premium
  AI narration owned by [AI](./ai.md). *(0049.)*
- **Hayal/Hedef Panosu (vision board)** — roadmap MVP feature: text-based single-goal anchor per
  user (goal + optional city + "neden"). `vision_boards` table (unique user); `VisionService`
  (`getMine`/`upsert`/`setAiNote`); idempotent upsert (mirrors mood). Premium AI note owned by
  [AI](./ai.md). `/hedef` edit page; card on `/panel` (no nav tab). *(0051.)*

## Gotchas / Known issues

- **Task-done toast streak** — panel `TodayPlan` PATCH does not return streak; after a DONE toggle,
  `PanelShell.refreshAfterTaskChange({ celebrateDone: true })` re-fetches `GET /coaching/today` and
  shows the success toast with the refreshed `streak.currentStreak` (never client-derived).
- **Plan delete chain** — bottom sheet `delete` action must not call API directly; always
  `confirm()` dialog first (same trust line as subscription cancel).
- **Past plan days are read-only** — `taskDate < today` blocks create/update/delete on the API
  (`COACHING_TASK_DATE_READONLY`); web hides add FAB, disables toggle/menu, shows a calm notice.
  Viewing past days (nav, datepicker, calendar dots) stays allowed.
- **Countdown date is authoritative content** — must come from `ContentService.getExamCalendar`,
  never `users.examDate`. `daysRemaining`/streak/completion are server-computed — never recompute on
  the client.
- **Study session status** enum is COMPLETED|ABANDONED (final outcome). A just-started session has
  `ended_at = null` and is NOT counted as activity until completed (the `has_session` query requires
  `ended_at` set).
- **Timer at 0 does not auto-finalize** — user must tap **Seansı bitir** (streak = conscious complete).
  `focusElapsed` pauses with the timer; does not increment after countdown hits 0.
- **Dial locked during active session** — only pause/complete/abandon; prevents accidental duration change.
- **`mock_exams.exam_id` is a SOFT ref** (no FK to content) — validated via ContentPort at write time.
  RLS on `mock_exams` + child policy on `mock_exam_subjects` (via EXISTS on parent).
- **Net never computed on FE** — display `totalNet` / trend values from API only. Trend UI = ProgressBar
  bars, not a chart library (DESIGN.md has no chart primitive).
- **AI cache invalidation** — mood/ghost/vision AI cache is invalidated only when the underlying
  value actually changes (`CASE … IS DISTINCT FROM` guard). Re-submitting the same mood or reloading
  never triggers a fresh LLM call.
- **Streak persistence is a snapshot/cache**; `current_streak` is always recomputed on read. Path to
  W5 = move `StreakService.getSummary` recompute behind `JobQueuePort` (nightly) — no hard dependency
  on the (unbound) queue adapter today.
- **DB-integration/e2e for coaching repositories was deferred** (pure unit tests cover the logic).
  Pre-existing e2e suites (`payments` on a dirty volume, `auth`/`health-down`) can show failures
  depending on local DB state; coaching specs are pure and DB-independent.
- **KVKK (conscious decision):** the existing `admin anonymize` only scrubs the `users` row; behavioral
  free-text like `mood_checkins.struggle_note` and `vision_boards.motivation` is **not** scrubbed. A
  holistic erasure step for all behavioral free-text is a W6/identity follow-up (tables are
  `onDelete: cascade`, so a real user delete cascades). See `modules/admin/infrastructure/admin-users.repository.ts`.
- **W2↔W3 seam:** mood reflection and ghost narration cross W2 (coaching domain logic) and W3 (AI LLM
  call). See [ai.md](./ai.md) for the AI side.
